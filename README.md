# NodeMCU_Based_Air-and-Noise-Monitoring-Dashboard-Over-IoT
Academic Project

Air and sound pollution is growing issue these days. It is necessary to monitor air 
quality for a better future and healthy living for all. We propose an air quality as well as 
sound pollution monitoring system that allows us to monitor and check air quality as well as 
sound pollution in particular area through IoT.
